# Overview


The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model to reduce machine downtime and maintenance costs, thereby boosting production efficiency. Through data analytics, we will anticipate and prevent machine failures, enhancing reliability and operational productivity. Success will be measured by tangible improvements in machine uptime and cost efficiencies.

# Business Understanding

This project develops a predictive maintenance model to minimize industrial machine failures, reducing costly downtime and maintenance expenses. By analyzing historical data of machine operations and failures, the model predicts malfunctions, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling. Such predictive insights aim to enhance operational efficiency, extend equipment lifespan, and uphold safety, offering a strategic advantage in manufacturing processes.
