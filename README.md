# Overview


The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model to reduce machine downtime and maintenance costs, thereby boosting production efficiency. Through data analytics, we will anticipate and prevent machine failures, enhancing reliability and operational productivity. Success will be measured by tangible improvements in machine uptime and cost efficiencies.

# 1- Business Understanding

In the rapidly evolving manufacturing landscape, machine downtimes can result in significant financial losses and disrupted supply chains. Businesses seek to minimize these unexpected downtimes by predicting potential machine failures ahead of time. Our goal, in this context, is to leverage available machine data to develop a predictive maintenance model. By analyzing various machine parameters, such as air temperature, rotational speed, and tool wear, we aim to identify patterns or signs that precede a machine failure. A successful predictive model would enable businesses to take proactive measures, ensuring that maintenance or replacements are scheduled during non-peak hours, thus minimizing disruptions and financial impacts. In essence, we aim to shift from a reactive maintenance approach to a more proactive and efficient one, optimizing operations and saving costs.
